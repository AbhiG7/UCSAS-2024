## Data Analytics and Visualization

### What is it?
- Raw data --> useful information
- Clean up messy data
- Discover patterns and insights by representing the data in different ways

### Why is it important?

- Proper data analytics can help improve decision making, show hidden trends, and help in forecasting
- In sports, improves team/individual performance, helps in scouting, etc.

## Data Analytics and Visualization (cont)

### Common Tools
- Common tools: R and Python
- Common libraries: Pandas and Matplotlib

## Basics and Terminology

- Each race is 300km (~50-70 laps depending on circuit)

## Data in F1

- Macro scale: analyse evolution of sport, performance of teams over their history
    - Team win history, top speed of cars over time, etc.
- Per team scale: analyze car performance at each race to tune setup and race strategy
    - Downforce, tire temperature, fuel consumption, etc.

- Data collection, Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data visualization


## Data Collection

- First Party Data: data collected by you or the organization itself
    - Social media followers, feedback forms, sensor data, etc.
- Second Party Data: data collected not directly by you
    - Trusted partners, web scraping, etc.
- Third Party Data: data collected from external sources
    - Kaggle, Unaffiliated companies, etc.
- Dataset: Formula 1 World Championship (1950-2023)


## Data Cleaning

- Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned
- Involves removing any errors, inconsistencies, or duplicates in the data
- It might also make sense to restructure the data as you see fit

## Data Analysis

<center>

</center>

- Explore the data, play around with it
- Using your intuition, place different data together and graph them
- Use statistical methods to discover patterns and trends in the data


## Data Visualization

- Final step of the data analytics process is data visualization
- Involves presenting the data in a visual format to make it easier to understand
- Tell a story with your graphs and visualizations
